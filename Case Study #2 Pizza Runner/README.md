All the information regarding this case study can be from the source using the following link: [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/). 

I chose to use MySQL to solve this case study instead of the provided embedded DB Fiddle, which defaults to PostgreSQL 13.

:warning: It's important to note that there is a discrepancy between the data shown in the "customer_orders" (2021) table on the [case study site](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/) and the year provided in the INSERT command used to create and populate the database for the case study (2020). :warning:

## üßº Data Cleaning

### 1. Updating the `customer_orders` Table

The following SQL command is used to update the `customer_orders` table:

```sql
UPDATE customer_orders
SET exclusions = IFNULL(exclusions, ''),
    extras = IFNULL(extras, '');
```
**Outcome**: This ensures that these fields are never NULL, which can help prevent errors in data processing or reporting.

## 2. Updating the `runner_orders` Table

### a. Updating NULL Values to Empty Strings

```sql
UPDATE runner_orders
SET 
    pickup_time = IFNULL(pickup_time, ' '),
    distance = IFNULL(distance, ' '),
    duration = IFNULL(duration, ' '),
    cancellation = IFNULL(cancellation, ' ');
```
**Outcome**: Once again, this ensures that these fields are never NULL, which can help prevent errors in data processing or reporting.

### b. Cleaning Up the Distance Column

```sql
UPDATE runner_orders
SET distance = TRIM(REPLACE(distance, 'km', ''));
```
**Outcome**: This results in a distance value that is purely numerical, which can facilitate numerical calculations and comparisons.

### c. Cleaning Up the Duration Column

```sql
UPDATE runner_orders
SET duration = TRIM(REPLACE(REPLACE(duration, 'minutes', ''), 'minute', ''));
```
**Outcome**: This ensures that duration values are purely numerical, facilitating better calculations and comparisons.

```sql
SELECT r.runner_id, c.order_id, r.distance,
  ROUND((r.distance/r.duration * 60), 2) AS speed
FROM runner_orders AS r
JOIN customer_orders AS c
  ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY r.runner_id, c.customer_id, c.order_id, r.distance, r.duration
ORDER BY r.runner_id
;
```
#### Steps:
- Calculate the speed using the formula (distance/duration) multiplied by 60 to convert to minutes.
- **JOIN** the `customer_orders` and the `runner_orders` tables using the order_id.
- Use **WHERE** Filter out orders with a distance of 0.

#### Answer:
| runner_id | order_id | distance | speed | 
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------| ----- | 
| 1           | 1 | 20        | 37.5    | 
| 1           | 2 | 20        | 44.44    | 
| 1           | 3 | 13.4        | 40.2    | 
| 1           | 10 | 10        | 60    | 
| 2           | 8 | 23.4        | 93.6    | 
| 2           | 4 | 23.4        | 35.1    | 
| 2           | 7 | 25        | 60    | 
| 3           | 5 | 10        | 40    | 

- On order 1 runner 1 had an avergage speed of 37.5.
- On order 2 runner 1 had an avergage speed of 44.44.
- On order 3 runner 1 had an avergage speed of 40.2.
- On order 10 runner 1 had an avergage speed of 60.
- On order 8 runner 2 had an avergage speed of 93.6.
- On order 4 runner 2 had an avergage speed of 35.1.
- On order 7 runner 2 had an avergage speed of 60.
- On order 5 runner 3 had an avergage speed of 40.
  
#### Observation:
- Speed Variation:
  - Runner 1 has different speeds for each order. For example, the speed ranges from 37.5 to 60, indicating inconsistent performance.
  - Runner 2 also shows significant speed differences, with a peak speed of 93.6 for order 8 and a low of 35.1 for order 4.
- Distance and Speed Relationship:
  - Shorter distances don‚Äôt always result in higher speeds. For instance, Runner 1 had a high speed of 60 over a distance of 10, but a lower speed of 44.44 over a longer distance of 20.

###7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```sql
SELECT runner_id, 
	ROUND(100 * SUM(CASE WHEN distance = 0 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 0) AS percentage
FROM runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
;
```
#### Steps:
- Use a **CASE** to count successful deliveries (where distance is not 0).
  - Calculate the percentage by dividing the successful deliveries by the total number of deliveries for each runner.

#### Answer:
|  runner_id | percentage |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1  | 100        |
| 2  | 75         |
| 3  | 50         |

- Runner 1 had a 100 percentage successful delivery rate.
- Runner 2 had a 75 percentage successful delivery rate.
- Runner 3 had a 50 percentage successful delivery rate.

:grey_exclamation: It‚Äôs unfair to credit successful deliveries to runners since order cancellations are beyond their control. :grey_exclamation:
