All the information regarding this case study can be from the source using the following link: [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/). 

I chose to use MySQL to solve this case study instead of the provided embedded DB Fiddle, which defaults to PostgreSQL 13.

:warning: It's important to note that there is a discrepancy between the data shown in the "customer_orders" table on the [case study site](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/) and the year provided in the INSERT command used to create and populate the database for the case study. :warning:
